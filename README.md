# Bayesian Matrix Factorization for Book Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This project implements a **Bayesian Matrix Factorization** system for book recommendations using variational inference, developed as a case study demonstrating advanced machine learning techniques with production-ready considerations. The implementation goes beyond standard collaborative filtering by incorporating uncertainty quantification, bias monitoring, and mathematical diagnostic frameworks.

**Key Achievement:** Built a mathematically rigorous recommendation system that not only provides predictions but quantifies prediction reliability through Bayesian uncertainty estimation.

## Technical Implementation

### Dataset and Preprocessing
- **Source:** BookCrossing dataset (278K users, 271K books, 1.15M ratings)
- **Filtering Strategy:** Active users (≥20 ratings) and popular books (≥50 ratings)
- **Final Dataset:** 2,978 users × 651 books with 30,479 ratings (98.43% sparse)
- **Split:** 80/20 train/test for generalization assessment

### Mathematical Framework

**Bayesian Matrix Factorization Model:**
```
R_ij ~ N(σ(U_i^T V_j), σ_noise²)
U_i ~ N(0, σ_prior² I)
V_j ~ N(0, σ_prior² I)
```

**Variational Inference:**
- Mean-field approximation with Gaussian variational posteriors
- ELBO optimization using coordinate ascent
- Point estimate approximation for sigmoid expectations
- Hyperparameters: k=5 latent factors, σ_prior=0.5, σ_noise=0.2

**Key Innovation - Diagnostic Framework:**
```python
# Quantify approximation bias
bias_stats = quantify_sigmoid_bias(mu_U, log_var_U, mu_V, log_var_V)
# Monitor assumption violations
corr_diag = compute_correlation_diagnostics(mu_U, mu_V)
```

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Training RMSE | 1.28/10 | Good fit to training data |
| Test RMSE | 1.68/10 | Competitive generalization |
| Generalization Gap | 0.44/10 | Minimal overfitting |
| Approximation Bias | 1.7% mean, 7% max | Low bias in point estimates |
| Factor Correlations | 47% max (user), 18% (item) | Acceptable mean-field violations |

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Mathematical Rigor:** Proper uncertainty quantification through Bayesian inference
2. **Diagnostic Framework:** Real-time monitoring of model assumptions and approximation quality
3. **Production Readiness:** Uncertainty-aware recommendations with confidence intervals
4. **Evaluation Methodology:** Proper train/test split revealing true generalization performance

### Limitations and Weaknesses

#### 1. **Fundamental Data Sparsity Challenge**
- **Issue:** 98.43% sparsity fundamentally limits collaborative filtering effectiveness
- **Impact:** Even sophisticated inference cannot overcome insufficient data density
- **Evidence:** Test RMSE plateau despite mathematical sophistication

#### 2. **Cold Start Problem**
- **Issue:** Cannot provide recommendations for new users/items without ratings
- **Business Impact:** Limits applicability for customer acquisition scenarios
- **Current Mitigation:** None implemented

#### 3. **Scalability Concerns**
- **Issue:** Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation requires 500+ samples per prediction
- **Impact:** ~0.5s latency per user for uncertainty quantification
- **Trade-off:** Accuracy vs. real-time performance

#### 4. **Mean-Field Approximation Violations**
- **Issue:** 47% maximum correlation between user factors violates independence assumption
- **Impact:** Potentially underestimated uncertainty in recommendations
- **Monitoring:** Diagnostic framework tracks but doesn't correct for violations

#### 5. **Limited Feature Integration**
- **Issue:** Only uses rating data, ignoring rich metadata (genres, user demographics)
- **Missed Opportunity:** Content-based features could address sparsity and cold-start

## Production Readiness Assessment

## Conclusion
